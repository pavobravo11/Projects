# Projects
An ongoing project of a 5 year analysis of three stocks
Currently, the program can generate random blends for the portfolio and plot them
Next, I would like to find the optimal blend for these individual securities create the capital market line and also plot their Betas

This repository includes:
      1. 5 years of historical monthly data for 4 individual securities 
      2. One csv file which has the real name of these companies
      3. The program itself
