# Projects
An ongoing project of a 5 year analysis of three stocks
Currently, the program can generate random blends for the portfolio and plot them
Next, I would like to find the optimal blend for these individual securities create the capital market line and also plot their Betas

This repository includes:
      1. 5 years of historical monthly data for 4 individual securities 
      2. One csv file which has the real name of these companies
      3. The program itself

For the program to function, one must change the path, the first variable path, must be the directory containing the 5 years of return of 4 stocks, and the second names_path must be a directory containing one csv file with the names of the stock along with the corporation names, alphabetized.
